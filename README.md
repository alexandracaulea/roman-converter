# Roman Numeral Converter

I've created a Roman Numeral Converter since I've wanted to start using ES6 modules in a project from start to finish and to practice testing my own code.

I've took the code that I've wrote for the _Roman Numeral Converter_ project, part of _JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification curriculum_ and I've also implemented an UI and added more functionality. You can check the live example [here](https://alexandracaulea.github.io/roman-converter/). For unit testing I've used [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
